<h3>Overview</h3>
This was my first 'no-server' project done during my time at Dev Mountain. This project focused on building my understanding of 
the Angular framework and how API calls work. <br><br>
Overall, I was better able to understand the use of routing using 'ui-router', and
the user of controllers and services. I was able to work with an established api published by <a href="https://api.giphy.com/">Giphy API</a>. 
Using this API I was able to learn about pagination displaying all the results returned by the API. 
<br><br>
This project incorporates Bootstrap's grid system in displayin the grid. It also puts the browser's local storage to use allowing the user to 
add/remove gifs to a favorites list.
